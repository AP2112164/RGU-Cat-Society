          <h2>Welcome to the RGU Cat Society</h2>
          <p>Hello and Welcome to the official website of the Robert Gordon's University Cat Society.</p>
          <p>The society is new addition to the Robert Gordon's University society list and we are looking for new members to join us. The RGU Cat Society is a small community of students that is located in the Sir Ian Wood Building at Robert Gordonâ€™s University. Our society allows RGU students from all courses and years to interact and socialise with each other to talk about their common interest: cats and anything relatable with them. </p>

          <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p>This society began at the start of the first semester of MMXXI to MMXXII, when five first year computing students, began to socialise on the university campus and the only thing that they were talking about was cats.</p>
          <p>One day, one of the students was on campus and saw that the RGU UNION was interested in adding a new society to their list</p>
